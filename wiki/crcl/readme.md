 - CRCL XSD DOCUMENTATION

    CRCL is an XML robot language for communication
    whose purpose is to standardize robot motion control
    (specifically grasping).  It sits above fieldbus communication
    but below planning level (e.g., PDDL, Redhat Optaplanner  
    two agility planners we use).  CRCL compares to  ROS topics
    (both moveit and joint level) but is more centralized under
    one XSD schema and is more portable (you don t need ROS).

        A breakdown of the CRCL XML schema (XSD) is presented below using XSLT to extract the
        the annotated comments per XSD definition. Below, CRCLCommands and CRCLStatus highlight
        the major command/status areas.
